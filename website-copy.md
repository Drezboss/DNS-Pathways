### Intro Blurb
We're DNA Pathways CIC—professionals who've lived it. When an EHCP stalls, a care plan is ignored, or a child is excluded, we step in. With social-care expertise, advocacy, and community sport under one roof, we help families rebuild after breakdown.

## 👥 About Us

### Our Mission
Standing beside families in crisis with expert, compassionate support that cuts through red tape and delivers real-world outcomes.

### Who We Are
We're a husband-and-wife duo with 30+ years in social care, safeguarding, and institutional advocacy—plus first-hand experience as parents of a disabled child. We know the frustration of feeling invisible to "the system," and we built DNA Pathways to change that.
